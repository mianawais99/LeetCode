 I started preparing for interviews and created a repository to keep all of my optimized solutions for practice questions. I would often revisit the questions and refer to online videos to come up with better solutions. As I plan to update this repository almost every day, I believe it would be beneficial to make it public.

 Most of my solutions are in Java, and you can easily search for a specific question by pressing Ctrl + F in your browser and typing the exact name or number of the question. If I have solved that particular question, you will find it in the table below. Just click on the "JAVA" link in the "Source Code" column to access the solution.

  hope this repository will help you in your interview preparations! All the best for your preps and keep working hard ðŸ˜Š
